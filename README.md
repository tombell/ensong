# Ensong

This is a small daemon that can run the background and watch directories for new
`.wav` or `.txt` files.

This is hyper specific to my workflow of handling my DJ mixes after recording.
It automates backing up the track list file to a GitHub repository and
converting the `.wav` file to `.aiff` (for backup) and `.mp3` (for uploading to
Mixcloud).

This project is probably only useful to myself, however feel free to use the
code for inspiration and learning.
